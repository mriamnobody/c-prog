I will post the Source code of programs which I used to practice and learn programming use C.

1) Even Odd

This is my first C program after a long time. Im brushing my programming skills using C.
I have created this simple C program which Checks Whether the entered Positive number is Even or Odd.
Following are more features of the simple program:_
  a) The program checks whether the entered number is positive or not._
  b) The program gives a dialogue to ask user whether to continue or terminate the program after checking number for Even or Odd._
